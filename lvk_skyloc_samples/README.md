# GW sources sky localisations

In this directory, there are two types of files.

* The congregated `skyloc_samples`
  * These are sky location posterior samples extracted from the posterior files of each event, in GWTC2.1 and GWTC3.
* The `skymaps` FITS files
  * These are the processed FITS files from each catalogue releases.

The LVK GW catalogues public posterior samples:
* GWTC2.1: https://zenodo.org/records/6513631
* GWTC3: https://zenodo.org/records/5546663
